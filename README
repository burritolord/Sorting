Sorting
=======

I created this sorting class to refamiliarize myself with a few
sorting algorithms as well as improve my knowledge in java generics.
Another one of my goals was to learn unit testing so I decided to
create JUnit test for each sorting algorithm. I plan on adding to
the class when ever I get a chance.  Algorithms to add include 
shell sort, bucket sort, radix sort, and counting sort.
