Sorting
=======

I created this sorting class to refamiliarize myself with a few
sorting algorithms as well as improve my knowledge in java generics.
Another one of my goals was to learn unit testing so I decided to
create JUnit test for each sorting algorithm. Algorithms to add include 
shell sort and bucket sort. 

Contains the following
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort
    - Heap sort
